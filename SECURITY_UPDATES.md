# Security and Storage Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Upload Authentication Requirement
- **Backend**: Modified `/backend/src/routes/memes.js` to require authentication for meme uploads
  - Added `authenticateToken` middleware to the upload endpoint
  - Removed fallback to anonymous uploads
  - Now only authenticated users can upload memes

- **Frontend**: Updated upload functionality to enforce authentication
  - Wrapped Upload route with `ProtectedRoute` component in `App.tsx`
  - Removed manual authentication checks from `Upload.tsx` (handled by ProtectedRoute)
  - Updated navigation to show "Login Required" for unauthenticated users

### 2. Meme Storage Preservation
- **Frontend Service**: Modified `/src/services/memeService.ts`
  - Removed automatic cleanup logic that deleted old memes when storage was full
  - Now throws an error instead of removing old memes when storage quota is exceeded
  - Preserves all existing memes regardless of storage constraints

### 3. User Interface Updates
- **Navigation**: Updated `/src/components/Navigation.tsx`
  - Added Upload link to navigation menu
  - Shows "Upload (Login Required)" for unauthenticated users
  - Direct upload access for authenticated users
  - Applied to both desktop and mobile navigation

- **Upload Page**: Updated `/src/pages/Upload.tsx`
  - Changed storage tip to indicate login requirement
  - Simplified authentication handling using ProtectedRoute

### 4. Testing
- **Backend Tests**: Updated `/backend/test-api.js`
  - Added tests to verify upload authentication requirement
  - Tests both authenticated and unauthenticated upload attempts
  - Confirms proper error handling for unauthorized requests

## Security Benefits

1. **Access Control**: Only authenticated users can upload content
2. **Data Integrity**: No automatic deletion of user-generated content
3. **User Experience**: Clear indication of authentication requirements
4. **Audit Trail**: All uploads are now tied to authenticated user accounts

## Technical Implementation

- Uses existing `authenticateToken` middleware for backend protection
- Leverages `ProtectedRoute` component for frontend route protection
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing meme data
- Preserves all existing functionality while adding security layers

## Testing

Run the backend test to verify authentication requirements:
```bash
cd backend
node test-api.js
```

The test will verify:
- Unauthenticated upload requests are rejected (401 status)
- Authenticated upload requests are processed (requires file)
- All existing functionality remains intact
